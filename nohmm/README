nohot_nohmm_all/	Modification of the nohot_all_good1 protocol in PacBio/
to remove the use of SAM in building an HMM in order to generate a consensus
sequence using another method to create a multiple sequence alignment (e.g. 
blasr).

nohot_nohmm_all_2/:	Modification of nohot_nohmm_all protocol to not use
inserts during the sam_iter stage to see if stage 5 is still successful due
to all-iter9.differences_from_real not aligning due to segements being too
long.

nohot_nohmm_all_2/:	Revised to be a modification of nohot_nohmm_all that
uses only one insert during the second iteration to see if the issue with
the final iteration being too long is due to the insert during iteration 6.

nohot_nohmm_all_3/:	Modification of nohot_nohmm_all protocol with
parameters to blasr adjusted to be more sensitive when aligning and
introducing a quality threshold for the reads aligning to the reference,
as well as only one insertion iteration during iteration 2.

nohot_nohmm_all_4/:	Modification of nohot_nohmm_all protocol with the
modifications of nohot_nohmm_all_3 and changes from using the training
reads set to the alignment reads set when building the multiple
sequence alignment used to build the new consensus sequence each iteration.

Deleted nohot_nohmm_all_2/ nohot_nohmm_all_3/ and nohot_nohmm_all_4/

Cleaned out results in nohot_nohmm_all and will rerun the revised
Makefile to include training and final alignment steps.

nohot_nohmm_all_2:	Modification of nohot_nohmm_all protocol to remove
the use of blastn and condensing the protocol to one initial blasr with all
subsequent blasr calls for training and generation of the consensus sequence
done within one script training-and-consensus-from-sam.

nohot_nohmm_all_3:	Modification of nohot_nohmm_all_2 protocol to use
a different read selection (similar to nohot_nohmm_all) in order to see if
the issue with nohot_nohmm_all_2 lies with the read selection (as opposed
to the blasr alignment or the model surgery logic).

nohot_nohmm_all_2_1:	Modification of parameters in nohot_nohmm_all_2 to
run simulataneously with that directory to save time trying to find the
optimal parameters to reduce the number of errors in the final consensus
sequence. Match and indel prob set to 0.8.

nohot_nohmm_all_2_2:	Modification of parameters in nohot_nohmm_all_2 to
run simulataneously with that directory to save time trying to find the
optimal parameters to reduce the number of errors in the final consensus
sequence. Match and indel prob set to 0.75.

nohot_hmm_all:	Modification of nohot_nohmm_all_2 to use nhmmer to
use nhmmer instead of blastn and blasr.
